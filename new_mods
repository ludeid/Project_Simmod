Health and Hunger:

each gridcell has a vegetation stat ([0, 100]?:
  increases by dVeg0 when empty
  increases by dVec2 when low level pred 
  increases by dVeg3 when top pred 
  decreases by dVeg1 when herbivore
 
 each type of animal has a hungerstat and a healthstat
  animal.hunger: between [0, 100]
  animal.health: between [0, 100]
  
  critical hunger is at 50:
   malnutrition, health increases/decreases proportional (^n?) to difference to 50.
  if health = 0:
    dies
  old vegetation is transferred to the "new" cell
  
  herbivores has an increase in hunger stat when on a cell with vegetation (or above threshhold(10?))
  predators has an increase in hunger stat when eating (different increases?)
  
 animals can only reproduce when hp is over a threshhold



movement system:
  animals cant see the situation on a cell before moving there (hence random).
  herbivores change to a random cell if vegetation is below a threshhold (10?)
    herbivores dies if moving to predator or cant move to predator. Or decreases hunger alot
  
  predators move to a random gridcell
    maybe not to where another animal is?
    
  moving decreases hunger:
    different for different animals
